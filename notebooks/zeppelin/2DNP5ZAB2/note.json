After purification, the fragmented fractions were treated with a mix of T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow Fragment and T4 polynucleotide kinase to repair blunt and phosphorylate ends. The blunt DNA fragments were subsequently 3\u0027 adenylated using Klenow Fragment (3\u0027-5\u0027 exo-) and then ligated by T4 DNA Ligase to adapters that were synthesized with 5\u0027-methylcytosine instead of 5\u0027-cytosine and contain index sequences inside. After each step, the reaction products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The constructed libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer with Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The liquid hybridization capture procedure was then performed as follows. Briefly, 200 ng DNA from each of five adapter-ligated libraries were pooled together. 10 µg human Cot-1 DNA and 1nmol of adapter complementary DNA oligos were added and subsequently were dried using a SpeedVac (eppendorf) at 60°C. After that, the mixture was denatured at 95°C for 10min in a final reaction volume of 10.5µl consisting of 7.5µl 2X SC Hybridization Buffer and 3µl SC Hybridization Component A. After centrifugation, 4.5µl of designed probes were added and the mixture was hybridized in a thermal cycler at 47°C for 72 hours with the lid heated at 57°C. After hybridization, the biotinylated probes bounded with the target DNA were captured using 100µl of Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen), which had been pre-washed two times with a total of 400µl Streptavidin Dynabead Binging and Washing Buffer. The capture program was 47°C for 45min in a thermal cycler with the lid heated at 57°C and vortexing for 3 seconds at 15min intervals. Discarded the unbounded fractions and washed the collected DNA-probe-beads complex with 100µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Wash Buffer I for one time and with a total of 400µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Stringent Wash Buffer I for two times with the incubations of 47°C for 5min. After discarding the supernatant, the collected beads complex was again washed with 200µl of 1X Wash Buffer I, 1X Wash Buffer II and 1X Wash Buffer III respectively. Finally, the captured DNA was eluted in 50µl of 10M NaOH with incubation at room temperature for 10min. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube and neutralized with 50µl of 10M HAc and then purified using MiniElute PCR purification Kit (Qiagen). For bisulfite conversion, 200ng unmethylated lambda DNA was added into each captured product as carriers and ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit™ (ZYMO) was employed to convert unmethylated cytosine into uracil according to the instructions.;\tAfter purification, PCR was carried out in a final reaction volume of 50µl consisting of 20µl converted products, 4µl 2.5mM dNTP, 5µl 10×buffer, 0.5µl JumpStart™ Taq DNA Polymerase (SIGMA), 1µl PCR primers1.0, 1µl PCR index primers (which were used to identify different captures) and 18.5µl water. The following thermal cycling program was 94°C 1 min, 15 cycles of 94 °C 10s, 58°C 30s, 72°C 30s then prolong at 72°C for 5min and hold at 12°C. The PCR products were purified using AMPure beads (Agencourt), quantified by the Bioanalyzer analysis system (Agilent) and real time PCR assay and then analyzed using Illumina Hiseq 2000. All of these samples were pooled into 7 libraries with a one-to-one correspondence 7bp barcode. The barcode information is following: s02_C-AATAACT-pooling1, s14_P-TGTAATT-pooling1, s96_P-ACTTGAT-pooling1, s00_C-AATAACT-pooling2, s13_C-TGTAATT-pooling2, s95_C-ACTTGAT-pooling2, s09_C-ATAATCT-pooling3, s15_P-TGTAATT-pooling3, s06_P-GTACATT-pooling4, s10_P-TATGCTT-pooling4, s16_C-TGTAATT-pooling4, s01_P-GTACATT-pooling5, s99_P-CGAATAT-pooling5, s95_C-CGAATAT-pooling6, s96_P-ACTTGAT-pooling6, s05_C-GTACATT-pooling7, s11_P-TATGCTT-pooling7, s12_C-TGTAATT-pooling7.

Then we filtered out the CpG sites with less than 4X sequencing depth in order to guarantee accurate calculation of methylation levels. Then analysed differential promoter DNA methylation between HCCs (Tumor) and peripheral normal tissues (NTL) as following. DMRs were searched using a sliding window strategy: firstly, we selected the both covered CpG sites in two samples with sequencing depth \u003e\u003d 5X as candidate sites. For each of candidate site, the ChiqX or Fisher test was performed to calculate the significant test P-value. Secondly, we selected the first differentially methylated CpG (P-value \u003c 0.05) as an initial locus of DMR, and began to merge these candidate sites into a candidate DMR with following criterion: 1, the distance between two neighbouring candidate sites \u003c\u003d 300bp; 2, all of candidate sites in the candidate DMR kept the same methylation status (hyper- or hypo-); and 3, a candidate DMR must harbor 5 or more candidate sites.

The RNA was eluted in a volume of 50ml.;\tFor library construction we used the SMART-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2013) in a 96 well plate format and with several modifications. 2 μl of RNA sample per well were mixed with 2ml RT primer (10mM 5 ́-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACT30VN-3 ́), 2ml dNTP mix (10mM each, Agilent Technologies) and 2ml Recombinant RNase Inhibitor (RRI-Clontech). This mix was incubated for 3min at 72°C and immediately placed on ice. To perform reverse transcription (RT) we added a mix of 1.5ml H2O, 4 ml Maxima buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific), 4 ml Betaine (5M SIGMA-ALDRICH), 1.8 ml MgCL2, 2ml TSO (10mM AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACrGrG+G), 0.5 RRI and 0.2ml Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase enzyme (ThermoFisher Scientific). We incubated the RT reaction mix at 42°C for 90 min followed by 10 cycles of 50°C for 2 min, 42°C for 2 min, afterwards heat inactivated the enzyme for 15 min at 70°C. We used 11ml of the RT reaction for the PCR reaction by adding 12.5 ml KAPA HiFi Hotstart (KAPA Biosystems), 1ml H2O and 0.5 ml of (10mM 5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3 ́) primer under the following conditions: 98°C for 3 min, 14 cycles of (98°C for 15 sec, 67°C for 20 sec, 72°C for 6 min), final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR product was used for library preparation with Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were combined and purified using Ampure XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter) and sequenced on a Hi-Seq 2500 (Illumina), to generate paired-end 25bp reads. Each sample was sequenced to an average depth of four million reads (IQR-2.3 -5.5 million).\t0610009D07Rik..MGLibA_00009snnT4\tWe created a Bowtie index based on the mm9 mouse reference genome, and then aligned paired-end reads directly to this index using Bowtie v 0.12.7 (Trapnell et al., 2009). Next, we ran RSEM v1.11 (Li and Dewey 2011) with default parameters on these alignments to estimate expression levels. RSEM’s gene level expression estimates (tau) were multiplied by 1,000,000 to obtain transcript per million (TPM) estimates for each gene. To transform expression levels to log-space, we took the log2(TPM+1). Sequencing libraries that correlated poorly (Pearson r\u003c0.8) with the majority of samples or had fewer than 500,000 expected counts across the transcriptome were removed from further analysis.;\tGenome_build: mm9;\tSupplementary_files_format_and_content: The log2(TPM+1) values were then quantile normalized, which reduced the coefficient of variation for each gene across samples. Without batch correction, samples separated strongly according to the experiment and plate in the first two principal components within a given time point. Batch correction was performed using the SVA package in R (Leek et al., n.d.). The primary known batch covariate was the plate on which the sample was processed. After batch correction, the effects associated with batch were attenuated.\t2015-03-23\t2015-07-16\tPublic on Jul 16 2015\tSRA\tName: Oren Parnas;\tEmail: oparnas@broadinstitute.org;\tLaboratory: Aviv Regev;\tDepartment: Biology;\tInstitute: BROAD INSTITUTE;\tAddress: 415 main street;\tCity: Cambridge;\tState: MA;\tZip/postal_code: 02142;\tCountry: USA\tGPL17021\n3232\t{\"tissue\": \"pancreas\", \"genotype:\": \"Ins1-/-:Ins2f/f:Pdx1CreERT:mTmG\", \"treatment\": \"Cre-T\", \"background strain\": \"mixed but mostly C57Bl/6\", \"tissue compartment\": \"islets\"}\t{}\t13-222\tGSM1910653\tGSE74113\tmus musculus\ttreatment: Cre-T; genotype: Ins1-/-:Ins2f/f:Pdx1CreERT:mTmG; background strain: mixed but mostly C57Bl/6; tissue: pancreas; tissue compartment: islets\ttotal RNA\tillumina hiseq 2500\tprimary cells\tMice were treated with tamoxifen 6 days prior to islet isolation to induce Ins2 gene deletion\tTotal RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Rneasy kit with the on-column Dnase treatment.

The cells were suspended in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and lysed by mechanical bead-beating at 4°C with 0.5-mm silica-zirconia beads (4 cycles of 3 min of beating followed by 2 min on ice). Following lysis, total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed from the RNA preparation with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies).;\tPoly(A) RNA was selected from the total using the mRNA Catcher Plus Kit (Life Technologies) with an epMotion 5075 automated pipettor (Eppendorf). The poly(A) RNA was subsequently sheared by incubating in TURBO DNA-free buffer at 75°C for 10 minutes and purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using random hexameric primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, followed by treatment with E. coli DNA ligase, DNA polymerase I, and RNase H for second-strand synthesis, all using standard methods. The cDNA libraries were end-repaired with a Quick Blunting kit and A-tailed using Klenow exo- with dATP (New England Biolabs). Illumina adapters were ligated to the cDNA and fragments ranging from 150-250 bp in size were selected using gel electrophoresis. The libraries were enriched and indexed in a 10-cycle PCR using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA (Fermentas), purified, and pooled in equimolar ratios for multiplex sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the Genome Technology Access Center.\tcultured cells\tSequenced reads were aligned to the C. neoformans H99 reference sequence (v2) using TopHat version 2.0.4 and Bowtie version 0.12.8;\tReads that aligned uniquely to the reference sequence were considered for gene expression quantification with Cufflinks version 2.0.2. Gene boundaries were defined using the current C. neoformans genome annotation provided by the Broad institute. Gene expression was normalized using the Cufflinks provided option for quartile normalization.;\tAfter gene expression quantification, samples not passing the following quality control filters were removed from consideration. The expression of the deleted gene in mutant expression profiles was required to be less than 10% of its expression in WT. The mean and median expression of the deleted genes were 0.7% and 0% of the WT levels respectively. The low levels of expression that remained for some samples were likely the result of errors in the sequencing process itself, either due to contamination between samples or a low level of error in matching barcodes for multiplexed samples to reads. Wild-type samples were required to express the resistance marker at less than 10% of its median level in all mutant expression profiles. In addition, to maximize the power to detect differentially expressed genes, a quality control filter was established to ensure that replicate expression profiles were in agreement. Specifically, within a replicate set the median of all gene coefficients of variation (CoV), defined as the standard deviation of gene expression over mean gene expression, was required to be less than or equal to 0.2. Any replicate set which did not pass this CoV filter was not used for differential expression analysis, and the mutant expression profiles were remade.

The cells were suspended in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and lysed by mechanical bead-beating at 4°C with 0.5-mm silica-zirconia beads (4 cycles of 3 min of beating followed by 2 min on ice). Following lysis, total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed from the RNA preparation with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies).;\tPoly(A) RNA was selected from the total using the mRNA Catcher Plus Kit (Life Technologies) with an epMotion 5075 automated pipettor (Eppendorf). The poly(A) RNA was subsequently sheared by incubating in TURBO DNA-free buffer at 75°C for 10 minutes and purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using random hexameric primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, followed by treatment with E. coli DNA ligase, DNA polymerase I, and RNase H for second-strand synthesis, all using standard methods. The cDNA libraries were end-repaired with a Quick Blunting kit and A-tailed using Klenow exo- with dATP (New England Biolabs). Illumina adapters were ligated to the cDNA and fragments ranging from 150-250 bp in size were selected using gel electrophoresis. The libraries were enriched and indexed in a 10-cycle PCR using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA (Fermentas), purified, and pooled in equimolar ratios for multiplex sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the Genome Technology Access Center.\tcultured cells\tSequenced reads were aligned to the C. neoformans H99 reference sequence (v2) using TopHat version 2.0.4 and Bowtie version 0.12.8;\tReads that aligned uniquely to the reference sequence were considered for gene expression quantification with Cufflinks version 2.0.2. Gene boundaries were defined using the current C. neoformans genome annotation provided by the Broad institute. Gene expression was normalized using the Cufflinks provided option for quartile normalization.;\tAfter gene expression quantification, samples not passing the following quality control filters were removed from consideration. The expression of the deleted gene in mutant expression profiles was required to be less than 10% of its expression in WT. The mean and median expression of the deleted genes were 0.7% and 0% of the WT levels respectively. The low levels of expression that remained for some samples were likely the result of errors in the sequencing process itself, either due to contamination between samples or a low level of error in matching barcodes for multiplexed samples to reads. Wild-type samples were required to express the resistance marker at less than 10% of its median level in all mutant expression profiles. In addition, to maximize the power to detect differentially expressed genes, a quality control filter was established to ensure that replicate expression profiles were in agreement. Specifically, within a replicate set the median of all gene coefficients of variation (CoV), defined as the standard deviation of gene expression over mean gene expression, was required to be less than or equal to 0.2. Any replicate set which did not pass this CoV filter was not used for differential expression analysis, and the mutant expression profiles were remade. However, replicate sets were rescued if the median CoV could be lowered below 0.2 by removing an outlier expression profile replicate.;\tDifferential expression analysis comparing matched mutant and wild type expression profile replicate sets was performed with Cuffdiff using a 5% false discovery rate. If multiple replicate sets of a mutant passed the quality control standards, only the replicate set with the lowest CoV was used for differential expression analysis.;\tGenome_build: C. neoformans H99 reference sequence (Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii H99 Sequencing Project);\tSupplementary_files_format_and_content: cuff: Gene expression was quantified processing tophat produced bam alignments with Cufflinks v0.9.3 with the current H99 annotation (v2) provided by the Broad institute\u0027s Fungal Genome initiative.

After purification, the fragmented fractions were treated with a mix of T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow Fragment and T4 polynucleotide kinase to repair blunt and phosphorylate ends. The blunt DNA fragments were subsequently 3\u0027 adenylated using Klenow Fragment (3\u0027-5\u0027 exo-) and then ligated by T4 DNA Ligase to adapters that were synthesized with 5\u0027-methylcytosine instead of 5\u0027-cytosine and contain index sequences inside. After each step, the reaction products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The constructed libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer with Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The liquid hybridization capture procedure was then performed as follows. Briefly, 200 ng DNA from each of five adapter-ligated libraries were pooled together. 10 µg human Cot-1 DNA and 1nmol of adapter complementary DNA oligos were added and subsequently were dried using a SpeedVac (eppendorf) at 60°C. After that, the mixture was denatured at 95°C for 10min in a final reaction volume of 10.5µl consisting of 7.5µl 2X SC Hybridization Buffer and 3µl SC Hybridization Component A. After centrifugation, 4.5µl of designed probes were added and the mixture was hybridized in a thermal cycler at 47°C for 72 hours with the lid heated at 57°C. After hybridization, the biotinylated probes bounded with the target DNA were captured using 100µl of Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen), which had been pre-washed two times with a total of 400µl Streptavidin Dynabead Binging and Washing Buffer. The capture program was 47°C for 45min in a thermal cycler with the lid heated at 57°C and vortexing for 3 seconds at 15min intervals. Discarded the unbounded fractions and washed the collected DNA-probe-beads complex with 100µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Wash Buffer I for one time and with a total of 400µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Stringent Wash Buffer I for two times with the incubations of 47°C for 5min. After discarding the supernatant, the collected beads complex was again washed with 200µl of 1X Wash Buffer I, 1X Wash Buffer II and 1X Wash Buffer III respectively. Finally, the captured DNA was eluted in 50µl of 10M NaOH with incubation at room temperature for 10min. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube and neutralized with 50µl of 10M HAc and then purified using MiniElute PCR purification Kit (Qiagen). For bisulfite conversion, 200ng unmethylated lambda DNA was added into each captured product as carriers and ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit™ (ZYMO) was employed to convert unmethylated cytosine into uracil according to the instructions.;\tAfter purification, PCR was carried out in a final reaction volume of 50µl consisting of 20µl converted products, 4µl 2.5mM dNTP, 5µl 10×buffer, 0.5µl JumpStart™ Taq DNA Polymerase (SIGMA), 1µl PCR primers1.0, 1µl PCR index primers (which were used to identify different captures) and 18.5µl water. The following thermal cycling program was 94°C 1 min, 15 cycles of 94 °C 10s, 58°C 30s, 72°C 30s then prolong at 72°C for 5min and hold at 12°C.

After purification, the fragmented fractions were treated with a mix of T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow Fragment and T4 polynucleotide kinase to repair blunt and phosphorylate ends. The blunt DNA fragments were subsequently 3\u0027 adenylated using Klenow Fragment (3\u0027-5\u0027 exo-) and then ligated by T4 DNA Ligase to adapters that were synthesized with 5\u0027-methylcytosine instead of 5\u0027-cytosine and contain index sequences inside. After each step, the reaction products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The constructed libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer with Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The liquid hybridization capture procedure was then performed as follows. Briefly, 200 ng DNA from each of five adapter-ligated libraries were pooled together. 10 µg human Cot-1 DNA and 1nmol of adapter complementary DNA oligos were added and subsequently were dried using a SpeedVac (eppendorf) at 60°C. After that, the mixture was denatured at 95°C for 10min in a final reaction volume of 10.5µl consisting of 7.5µl 2X SC Hybridization Buffer and 3µl SC Hybridization Component A. After centrifugation, 4.5µl of designed probes were added and the mixture was hybridized in a thermal cycler at 47°C for 72 hours with the lid heated at 57°C. After hybridization, the biotinylated probes bounded with the target DNA were captured using 100µl of Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen), which had been pre-washed two times with a total of 400µl Streptavidin Dynabead Binging and Washing Buffer. The capture program was 47°C for 45min in a thermal cycler with the lid heated at 57°C and vortexing for 3 seconds at 15min intervals. Discarded the unbounded fractions and washed the collected DNA-probe-beads complex with 100µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Wash Buffer I for one time and with a total of 400µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Stringent Wash Buffer I for two times with the incubations of 47°C for 5min. After discarding the supernatant, the collected beads complex was again washed with 200µl of 1X Wash Buffer I, 1X Wash Buffer II and 1X Wash Buffer III respectively. Finally, the captured DNA was eluted in 50µl of 10M NaOH with incubation at room temperature for 10min. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube and neutralized with 50µl of 10M HAc and then purified using MiniElute PCR purification Kit (Qiagen). For bisulfite conversion, 200ng unmethylated lambda DNA was added into each captured product as carriers and ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit™ (ZYMO) was employed to convert unmethylated cytosine into uracil according to the instructions.;\tAfter purification, PCR was carried out in a final reaction volume of 50µl consisting of 20µl converted products, 4µl 2.5mM dNTP, 5µl 10×buffer, 0.5µl JumpStart™ Taq DNA Polymerase (SIGMA), 1µl PCR primers1.0, 1µl PCR index primers (which were used to identify different captures) and 18.5µl water. The following thermal cycling program was 94°C 1 min, 15 cycles of 94 °C 10s, 58°C 30s, 72°C 30s then prolong at 72°C for 5min and hold at 12°C.

The RNA was eluted in a volume of 50ml.;\tFor library construction we used the SMART-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2013) in a 96 well plate format and with several modifications. 2 μl of RNA sample per well were mixed with 2ml RT primer (10mM 5 ́-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACT30VN-3 ́), 2ml dNTP mix (10mM each, Agilent Technologies) and 2ml Recombinant RNase Inhibitor (RRI-Clontech). This mix was incubated for 3min at 72°C and immediately placed on ice. To perform reverse transcription (RT) we added a mix of 1.5ml H2O, 4 ml Maxima buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific), 4 ml Betaine (5M SIGMA-ALDRICH), 1.8 ml MgCL2, 2ml TSO (10mM AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACrGrG+G), 0.5 RRI and 0.2ml Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase enzyme (ThermoFisher Scientific). We incubated the RT reaction mix at 42°C for 90 min followed by 10 cycles of 50°C for 2 min, 42°C for 2 min, afterwards heat inactivated the enzyme for 15 min at 70°C. We used 11ml of the RT reaction for the PCR reaction by adding 12.5 ml KAPA HiFi Hotstart (KAPA Biosystems), 1ml H2O and 0.5 ml of (10mM 5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3 ́) primer under the following conditions: 98°C for 3 min, 14 cycles of (98°C for 15 sec, 67°C for 20 sec, 72°C for 6 min), final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR product was used for library preparation with Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were combined and purified using Ampure XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter) and sequenced on a Hi-Seq 2500 (Illumina), to generate paired-end 25bp reads. Each sample was sequenced to an average depth of four million reads (IQR-2.3 -5.5 million).\t0610009D07Rik..MGLibA_00009snnT4\tWe created a Bowtie index based on the mm9 mouse reference genome, and then aligned paired-end reads directly to this index using Bowtie v 0.12.7 (Trapnell et al., 2009). Next, we ran RSEM v1.11 (Li and Dewey 2011) with default parameters on these alignments to estimate expression levels. RSEM’s gene level expression estimates (tau) were multiplied by 1,000,000 to obtain transcript per million (TPM) estimates for each gene. To transform expression levels to log-space, we took the log2(TPM+1). Sequencing libraries that correlated poorly (Pearson r\u003c0.8) with the majority of samples or had fewer than 500,000 expected counts across the transcriptome were removed from further analysis.;\tGenome_build: mm9;\tSupplementary_files_format_and_content: The log2(TPM+1) values were then quantile normalized, which reduced the coefficient of variation for each gene across samples. Without batch correction, samples separated strongly according to the experiment and plate in the first two principal components within a given time point. Batch correction was performed using the SVA package in R (Leek et al., n.d.). The primary known batch covariate was the plate on which the sample was processed. After batch correction, the effects associated with batch were attenuated.\t2015-03-23\t2015-07-16\tPublic on Jul 16 2015\tSRA\tName: Oren Parnas;\tEmail: oparnas@broadinstitute.org;\tLaboratory: Aviv Regev;\tDepartment: Biology;\tInstitute: BROAD INSTITUTE;\tAddress: 415 main street;\tCity: Cambridge;\tState: MA;\tZip/postal_code: 02142;\tCountry: USA\tGPL17021\n3232\t{\"tissue\": \"pancreas\", \"genotype:\": \"Ins1-/-:Ins2f/f:Pdx1CreERT:mTmG\", \"treatment\": \"Cre-T\", \"background strain\": \"mixed but mostly C57Bl/6\", \"tissue compartment\": \"islets\"}\t{}\t13-222\tGSM1910653\tGSE74113\tmus musculus\ttreatment: Cre-T; genotype: Ins1-/-:Ins2f/f:Pdx1CreERT:mTmG; background strain: mixed but mostly C57Bl/6; tissue: pancreas; tissue compartment: islets\ttotal RNA\tillumina hiseq 2500\tprimary cells\tMice were treated with tamoxifen 6 days prior to islet isolation to induce Ins2 gene deletion\tTotal RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Rneasy kit with the on-column Dnase treatment.

After purification, the fragmented fractions were treated with a mix of T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow Fragment and T4 polynucleotide kinase to repair blunt and phosphorylate ends. The blunt DNA fragments were subsequently 3\u0027 adenylated using Klenow Fragment (3\u0027-5\u0027 exo-) and then ligated by T4 DNA Ligase to adapters that were synthesized with 5\u0027-methylcytosine instead of 5\u0027-cytosine and contain index sequences inside. After each step, the reaction products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The constructed libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer with Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The liquid hybridization capture procedure was then performed as follows. Briefly, 200 ng DNA from each of five adapter-ligated libraries were pooled together. 10 µg human Cot-1 DNA and 1nmol of adapter complementary DNA oligos were added and subsequently were dried using a SpeedVac (eppendorf) at 60°C. After that, the mixture was denatured at 95°C for 10min in a final reaction volume of 10.5µl consisting of 7.5µl 2X SC Hybridization Buffer and 3µl SC Hybridization Component A. After centrifugation, 4.5µl of designed probes were added and the mixture was hybridized in a thermal cycler at 47°C for 72 hours with the lid heated at 57°C. After hybridization, the biotinylated probes bounded with the target DNA were captured using 100µl of Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen), which had been pre-washed two times with a total of 400µl Streptavidin Dynabead Binging and Washing Buffer. The capture program was 47°C for 45min in a thermal cycler with the lid heated at 57°C and vortexing for 3 seconds at 15min intervals. Discarded the unbounded fractions and washed the collected DNA-probe-beads complex with 100µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Wash Buffer I for one time and with a total of 400µl of 47°C pre-warmed 1X Stringent Wash Buffer I for two times with the incubations of 47°C for 5min. After discarding the supernatant, the collected beads complex was again washed with 200µl of 1X Wash Buffer I, 1X Wash Buffer II and 1X Wash Buffer III respectively. Finally, the captured DNA was eluted in 50µl of 10M NaOH with incubation at room temperature for 10min. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube and neutralized with 50µl of 10M HAc and then purified using MiniElute PCR purification Kit (Qiagen). For bisulfite conversion, 200ng unmethylated lambda DNA was added into each captured product as carriers and ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit™ (ZYMO) was employed to convert unmethylated cytosine into uracil according to the instructions.;\tAfter purification, PCR was carried out in a final reaction volume of 50µl consisting of 20µl converted products, 4µl 2.5mM dNTP, 5µl 10×buffer, 0.5µl JumpStart™ Taq DNA Polymerase (SIGMA), 1µl PCR primers1.0, 1µl PCR index primers (which were used to identify different captures) and 18.5µl water.

The PCR products were purified using AMPure beads (Agencourt), quantified by the Bioanalyzer analysis system (Agilent) and real time PCR assay and then analyzed using Illumina Hiseq 2000. All of these samples were pooled into 7 libraries with a one-to-one correspondence 7bp barcode.

For each of candidate site, the ChiqX or Fisher test was performed to calculate the significant test P-value. Secondly, we selected the first differentially methylated CpG (P-value \u003c 0.05) as an initial locus of DMR, and began to merge these candidate sites into a candidate DMR with following criterion: 1, the distance between two neighbouring candidate sites \u003c\u003d 300bp; 2, all of candidate sites in the candidate DMR kept the same methylation status (hyper- or hypo-); and 3, a candidate DMR must harbor 5 or more candidate sites.

In addition, the mean and median expression of USV101 in overexpression mutants was 801% and 844% of WT USV101 levels respectively. Wild-type samples were required to express the resistance marker at less than 10% of its median level in all mutant expression profiles. In addition, to maximize the power to detect differentially expressed genes, a quality control filter was established to ensure that replicate expression profiles were in agreement. Specifically, within a replicate set the median of all gene coefficients of variation (CoV), defined as the standard deviation of gene expression over mean gene expression, was required to be less than or equal to 0.2. Any replicate set which did not pass this CoV filter was not used for differential expression analysis, and the mutant expression profiles were remade. However, replicate sets were rescued if the median CoV could be lowered below 0.2 by removing an outlier expression profile replicate.;\tCounts of reads mapping to each gene were quantitated using the htseq-count tool in version 0.5.3 of the HTSeq Python package.;\tDifferential expression analysis comparing mutant and wildtype expression profiles sets in the same condition was performed by using LIMMA with the voom transformation applied to read counts.;\tGenome_build: ASM14924v2, C. neoformans H99 reference sequence (Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii H99 Sequencing Project);\tSupplementary_files_format_and_content: cuff: Gene expression was quantified processing tophat produced bam alignments with Cufflinks v2.0.2 with the current H99 annotation (v2) provided by the Broad institute\u0027s Fungal Genome initiative.

The cells were suspended in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and lysed by mechanical bead-beating at 4°C with 0.5-mm silica-zirconia beads (4 cycles of 3 min of beating followed by 2 min on ice). Following lysis, total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed from the RNA preparation with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies).;\tPoly(A) RNA was selected from the total using the mRNA Catcher Plus Kit (Life Technologies) with an epMotion 5075 automated pipettor (Eppendorf). The poly(A) RNA was subsequently sheared by incubating in TURBO DNA-free buffer at 75°C for 10 minutes and purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using random hexameric primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, followed by treatment with E. coli DNA ligase, DNA polymerase I, and RNase H for second-strand synthesis, all using standard methods. The cDNA libraries were end-repaired with a Quick Blunting kit and A-tailed using Klenow exo- with dATP (New England Biolabs). Illumina adapters were ligated to the cDNA and fragments ranging from 150-250 bp in size were selected using gel electrophoresis. The libraries were enriched and indexed in a 10-cycle PCR using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA (Fermentas), purified, and pooled in equimolar ratios for multiplex sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the Genome Technology Access Center.\tcultured cells\tSequenced reads were aligned to the C. neoformans H99 reference sequence (v2) using TopHat version 2.0.4 and Bowtie version 0.12.8;\tReads that aligned uniquely to the reference sequence were considered for gene expression quantification with Cufflinks version 2.0.2. Gene boundaries were defined using the current C. neoformans genome annotation provided by the Broad institute. Gene expression was normalized using the Cufflinks provided option for quartile normalization.;\tAfter gene expression quantification, samples not passing the following quality control filters were removed from consideration. The expression of the deleted gene in mutant expression profiles was required to be less than 10% of its expression in WT. The mean and median expression of the deleted genes were 0.7% and 0% of the WT levels respectively. The low levels of expression that remained for some samples were likely the result of errors in the sequencing process itself, either due to contamination between samples or a low level of error in matching barcodes for multiplexed samples to reads. Wild-type samples were required to express the resistance marker at less than 10% of its median level in all mutant expression profiles. In addition, to maximize the power to detect differentially expressed genes, a quality control filter was established to ensure that replicate expression profiles were in agreement. Specifically, within a replicate set the median of all gene coefficients of variation (CoV), defined as the standard deviation of gene expression over mean gene expression, was required to be less than or equal to 0.2. Any replicate set which did not pass this CoV filter was not used for differential expression analysis, and the mutant expression profiles were remade. However, replicate sets were rescued if the median CoV could be lowered below 0.2 by removing an outlier expression profile replicate.;\tDifferential expression analysis comparing matched mutant and wild type expression profile replicate sets was performed with Cuffdiff using a 5% false discovery rate.

Total RNA integrity was initially assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide labeling in the presence of Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche) to visualize intact 28S and 18S rRNA bands. The RNA was further purified using an RNA Clean-Up and Concentration Kit (Norgen Biotek, Thorold, Ontario, Canada) prior to sequencing.; Small RNA-Seq libraries were generated using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), according to the manufacturer\u0027s protocols. In brief, 300 ng total RNA (as determined by the Qubit RNA assay, Life Technologies) with an RNA Quality Score \u003e 7 (as determined by the LabChip GX Microfluidics Electrophoresis system, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was used to prepare sequencing libraries. The small RNAs were targeted with modified Illumina-compatible 3’ and 5\u0027 adaptors and a reverse transcription primer. Next, first strand synthesis was achieved using Protoscript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs), followed by 15 cycles of PCR amplification. The small RNA-Seq libraries were then assessed for relative amounts of micro RNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) migrating between 140 to 160 bp using the LabChip GX DNA assay (PerkinElmer). DNA concentrations were assessed using the Qubit fluorometer.

The RNA was further purified using an RNA Clean-Up and Concentration Kit (Norgen Biotek, Thorold, Ontario, Canada) prior to sequencing.; Long total RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The Ribo-Zero kit was utilized to remove contaminating ribosomal RNA and mitochondrial RNA while retaining both coding and non-coding long RNAs in the subsequent libraries. A Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies) and BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) were used to select transcripts of appropriate mass and insert size. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 system and HiSeq version 3 sequencing reagents were used to generate 50 bp single-end reads. Automated clonal amplification was accomplished using the cBOT system (Illumina) using Illumina HiSeq version 3 cluster generation reagents to achieve a target density of approximately 800,000/mm^2 in a single flow cell channel.
